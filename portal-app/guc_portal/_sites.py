"""Which university portal are we talking to?

GUC (Cairo) and GIU run the same SIS/portal software, so one client works for
both. Only the host and a few page paths differ, and they live here. Pick a site
with `GucPortal(site="guc")` or the GUC_SITE env var.

The dropdown id-suffixes (stdYrLst, cmGpaLbl, Dropdownlistseason, smCrsLst) are
the SAME on both, which is why the parsing needs no per-site tweak. Only the
control-id PREFIX differs, and we handle that by reading each field's real name
off the page instead of hard-coding it.

GUC is verified against the live portal. GIU is a starting point taken from a GIU
project on the same software: the transcript path is known, the grades paths are
best guesses. Confirm them once a GIU login is available.
